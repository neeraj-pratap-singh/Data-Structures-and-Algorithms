# The provided image seems to describe a Morris Traversal approach for flattening a binary tree.
# Morris Traversal is an in-place binary tree traversal method that does not use recursion or a stack.
# The algorithm works by temporarily modifying the tree's structure, linking each node's predecessor to itself.
# After visiting a node, the algorithm restores the original tree structure.
